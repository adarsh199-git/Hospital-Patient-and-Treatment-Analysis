# Hospital-Patient-and-Treatment-Analysis
A hospital wants to analyze patient treatment records to improve healthcare services. To analyze hospital patient records and improve decision-making through data insights.
# Project Objectives:
To analyze hospital patient records and improve decision-making through data insights.
# Tools Used:
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib),SQL,Power BI
# Dataset Used:
* This Hospital Patient Treatment Dataset contains simulated data representing patient treatments in a multi-specialty hospital. It includes 200 records with both categorical   and numerical fields, designed for data visualization and analysis using tools like Power BI,Sql, or Python.
* The dataset features 3â€“4 categorical fields: Department (e.g., Cardiology, Neurology, Orthopedics), Treatment Type (Surgery, Medication, Therapy, Observation), Doctor Name, and Gender. It also includes numerical fields such as Age, Treatment Cost, Hospital Stay (Days), and Recovery Score (ranging from 0 to 100).
* To get more information about Columns visit: https://colorstech.net/practice-datasets/hospital-patient-treatment-dataset-for-analysis/
* This dataset is ideal for healthcare analysts and data enthusiasts who want to practice analyzing treatment efficiency, patient demographics, cost effectiveness, and healthcare outcomes. Potential analyses include cost comparisons by department, gender-based treatment patterns, doctor performance based on recovery scores, and identifying which treatments lead to faster recovery.

It can help simulate real-world healthcare reporting scenarios, such as understanding hospital load, cost optimization, or patient well-being tracking. The inclusion of unique Patient ID allows for easy referencing and segmentation.
